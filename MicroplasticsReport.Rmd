## Methodology
The Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research (MIPPR) uses FTIR for the determination of microplastics greater than 50 µm in size in source water as required by the California State Water Board’s Method for Microplastics Analysis in Drinking Water (State Water Resources Control Board, 2022 and MIPPR, 2024). However, this report includes microplastics greater than 50 µm as the software analysis method developed by MIPPR can identify microplastics at 50 µm based on FTIR pixel size. The process is based on peer-reviewed literature and the results and recommendations from an international microplastic method evaluation study (De Frond et al., 2022). 

## Sample Preparation
Samples were transferred into a 1-liter sample jar, and `r volume_added` were added. The samples were stirred with a metal spoon, shaken, then allowed to sit. The samples were wet sieved through a stack of sieves: 500 µm, 212 µm, and 20 µm. The collected material from each sieve was rinsed and collected into discrete sample jars containing the derived samples, except for sample MBC-BODY-50-100 MM, which was spilled during sieving. The 500 µm derived samples were handpicked for microplastics using a stereoscope. The suspected particles were analyzed with FTIR. The 212 µm and 20 µm derived samples were digested in `r digestion` (H~2~O~2~), then sieved and density separated in a `r density` (CaCl~2~). The sample was then filtered onto one or more `r filter` FTIR analysis. If the sample contained too much sediment, an aliquot was taken, and the volume of aliquot to sample was recorded. 
Please see the Notes and Recommendations section for descriptions and definitions of the sample nomenclature.

## Sample Analysis - FTIR
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used for chemical identification, counting, and sizing plastic particles in accordance with the above-referenced methods. A 16 mm~2~ area of each filter was mapped and analyzed. 
All particles in the area were characterized by chemical ID, projected area, and length. A black-and-white mosaic image was created for each polymer type that can be referenced against the spectral heat maps. A summary table (Table 2) reports particle polymer class information and percentages. The top correlation of spectral match of 60% for each sample was recorded. 
The FTIR files of the raw spectra (.map) and the mosaic images (.jpeg) are included in the data package submitted with this report. 

## Compound Microscope Scans, Stereoscope Images, and Photographs
In addition to FTIR mosaic images, compound microscope scans, stereoscope images, and photographs were collected from a portion of the samples to be used for additional information and QA/QC purposes. These images can be found in the submitted data package.

## Data Analysis
The FTIR spectral results were analyzed using OpenSpecy software, version `r packageVersion("OpenSpecy")`. Nonplastic particles found in the sample were not included in the final results. Table 1 presents the number of plastic particles in each sample and the percentage of each polymer by count and size class. Table 2 presents the types of polymers detected, particle count by polymer type, and percent of total polymers by each polymer type for all samples. Raw data and the OpenSpecy code are in the submitted data package.

## MIPPR Quality Assurance/Quality Control Samples
With each batch of samples, the MIPPR laboratory prepared a procedural blank and a laboratory-fortified blank, spiked with a known number of particles of particular plastic and size classes. The procedural blank indicates the level of contamination that could come from the laboratory procedure. The identification of and percent recovery of particles in the laboratory fortified blank provide information as to the accuracy of the method. The results of the MIPPR QA/QC samples are presented in Tables 3A-B.

## Data Summary
Here, we summarize the number of particles per sample, the polymer types, and size characteristics. The data set includes a .csv file for particle measurements (particle_details_all) and a file of spectra wavelength measurements for the particle polymers (particle_spec_all.rds).

The plastic particle counts for all samples are summarized below in Table 1. The particle counts in the samples ranged from `r min(plastic_count[["Particle Count"]])` to `r format(max(plastic_count[["Particle Count"]]), big.mark = ",")` particles. Table 2 presents the types of polymers detected, particle count by polymer type, and percent of total polymers by each polymer type for all samples. `r str_to_title(as.character(english(nrow(polymer_count))))` polymer types were detected, the most common were `r polymer_count[1,1] |> pull()`, at `r polymer_count[1,3]` percent of the total number of polymers detected, and `r polymer_count[2,1] |> pull()`, which accounted for `r polymer_count[2,3] |> pull()` percent of the total number of polymers detected.

## QA/QC Data

The MIPPR laboratory ran a laboratory procedural blank (PB) with each batch of samples. One liter of microplastics-analysis-grade (MAG) water was prepared and analyzed using the same procedures as the `r project_name` samples. The results are reported in 3A and the data are included in the attached data package. The results of the procedural blanks indication possible laboratory contamination introduced during sample preparation and analysis.

The MIPPR laboratory tracks the accuracy and precision of the analytical method through Laboratory Fortified Blanks (LFBs). An LFB is a sample of MAG water spiked with a known type and quantity of plastic material. LFBs were spiked with polyamide 66 (sized >500 µm), cellulose acetate (sizes 212-500 µm), and red beads (polyolefins sized 75-90 µm). The recoveries of the spiked polymers were `r pa66`, `r cellu`, and `r poly`%, respectively (Table 3B). The `r recover`, is not within the acceptable range of 50% -150%, as defined by the method.
